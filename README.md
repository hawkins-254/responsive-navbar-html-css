Beginner HTML and CSS responsive sidebar navigation project as part of my learning journey

This is my first HTML/CSS project. Itâ€™s a responsive sidebar navigation menu built using basic CSS positioning and Font Awesome icons.

  What I Learned:
- HTML semantic structure
- Linking Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons
- CSS positioning: fixed, absolute
- Basic animations with CSS transitions
- Simple responsive layout tricks (checkbox hack)
